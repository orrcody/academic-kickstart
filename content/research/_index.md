### Clocking Into Work and Out of Class:  How College Students Make Their Credit Intensity and Financing Decisions
*Job market paper*
**Abstract:** This paper studies how college students make and finance their credit hour enrollment, paying particular attention to the role of financial resources and beliefs. To formalize these relationships, I construct a dynamic structural model where students choose their credit hours, work hours, and borrowing to maximize lifetime utility. I collect data from two sources to estimate the model: (1) a unique survey of Michigan State undergraduates eliciting their employment history, family financial support, beliefs about the returns to studying and earning a high GPA, and (2) administrative data from the University. Estimates of the model suggest that students' credit hour decision is inelastic with respect to changes in aid, tuition, beliefs, or wages. Students' labor supply and borrowing decisions are responsive to changes in wages, and for a subset of students, changes in beliefs. I also conduct two counterfactual simulations, increasing minimum wage and making college tuition free, and evaluate how the policies affect student decisions and outcomes.

### The Evolution of the Wage Elasticity of Labor Supply over Time 
*Joint with Todd Elder and Steven J. Haider*  
**Abstract:** The wage elasticity of labor supply is arguably one of the most fundamental parameters in economics.  Despite the central role of this parameter, little is known about how it has changed over time.  We examine the evolution of the labor supply elasticity using cross-sectional methods.  We find robust evidence that the labor supply elasticities for married and single men and women have increased modestly over the last two decades.  For women, this finding is a substantial departure from earlier evidence.  We also contribute to the literature on the robustness of discrete choice labor supply models, focusing on assumptions that could affect our findings.  Our results suggest that the estimated trends are remarkably similar across a variety of specifications.

### Peer Gender Composition and Non-Cognitive Outcomes
**Abstract:** This paper studies the effect of the gender composition of a student’s peers on two non-cognitive skills: sense of belonging and self-worth. Using data from Add Health and exploiting idiosyncratic variation in the share of female peers across grades within schools, I find a small and statistically significant positive effect of a higher share of female peers on both non-cognitive skills for male students. I do not find evidence of an effect for female students.

### Why Students Do Not Study: Quantifying the Role of Expectations
**Abstract:** This paper explores the relationship between college students’ beliefs about the returns to studying and their reported study hours. Using novel survey data, I report the typical study hours of students and how study behavior differs by student observables like gender, race, college, etc. I then describe students’ beliefs about the GPA returns to studying and future labor market returns to graduating with a high GPA and quantify the heterogeneity of returns and uncertainty of returns. Next, I present correlations in the data between students’ observables and their beliefs about the returns to studying and earning a high GPA. Finally, I regress reported schoolwork hours on these beliefs to quantify the relationship between these variables.
