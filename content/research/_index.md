#### Peer Gender Composition and Non-Cognitive Factors. Applied Economics Letters. Forthcoming.
**Abstract:** This note studies the relationship between the gender composition of a student’s peers and two of their non-cognitive factors: sense of belonging and self-worth. Using data from Add Health and exploiting idiosyncratic variation in the share of female peers across grades within schools, I find positive but small effects of a higher share of female peers for male students. I do not find statistically significant effects for female students, but I can rule out large positive effects.

### Working Papers

#### Clocking into Work and Out of Class: College Student Enrollment, Labor Supply, and Borrowing

**Abstract:** This paper studies how college students choose their credit hour enrollment, labor supply, and borrowing, paying particular attention to the role of wages, financial resources and beliefs. To formalize these relationships, I construct a dynamic structural model where students choose their credit hours, work hours, and borrowing to maximize lifetime utility. I collect data from two sources to estimate the model: (1) a unique survey of Michigan State undergraduates eliciting their employment history, family financial support, beliefs about the returns to studying and beliefs about earning a high GPA, and (2) administrative data from the University. Estimates of the model suggest that students’ credit hour decision is inelastic with respect to changes in financial aid, tuition, beliefs, or wages. Students’ labor supply and borrowing decisions are responsive to changes in wages, and for a subset of students, changes in beliefs. I also conduct two counterfactual simulations, increasing the minimum wage and making college tuition free, and evaluate how these policy changes affect student decisions and outcomes.

#### The Evolution of the Wage Elasticity of Labor Supply over Time 
*Joint with [Todd Elder](https://sites.google.com/view/toddelder/) and [Steven J. Haider](https://sites.google.com/view/haider-webpage/home)*  
**Abstract:** The wage elasticity of labor supply is arguably one of the most fundamental parameters in economics.  Despite the central role of this parameter, little is known about how it has changed over time.  We examine the evolution of the labor supply elasticity using cross-sectional methods.  We find robust evidence that the labor supply elasticities for married and single men and women have increased modestly over the last two decades.  For women, this finding is a substantial departure from earlier evidence.  We also contribute to the literature on the robustness of discrete choice labor supply models, focusing on assumptions that could affect our findings.  Our results suggest that the estimated trends are remarkably similar across a variety of specifications.

### Work in progress

#### Why Students Do Not Study: Quantifying the Role of Expectations
**Abstract:** This paper explores the relationship between college students’ beliefs about the returns to studying and their reported study hours. Using novel survey data, I report the typical study hours of students and how study behavior differs by student observables like gender, race, college, etc. I then describe students’ beliefs about the GPA returns to studying and future labor market returns to graduating with a high GPA and quantify the heterogeneity of returns and uncertainty of returns. Next, I present correlations in the data between students’ observables and their beliefs about the returns to studying and earning a high GPA. Finally, I regress reported schoolwork hours on these beliefs to quantify the relationship between these variables.

#### Returns to School Spending in Rural America
*Joint with [Riley Acton](https://sites.google.com/view/rileyacton/) and Salem Rogers*  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we evaluate the impact of Wisconsin’s Sparsity Aid Program, a program that provides $25 million dollars annually to over 140 small, rural school districts in the state. We leverage the introduction and subsequent expansion of the program in event study and difference-in-differences designs that compare the outcomes of school districts that were eligible and ineligible for sparsity aid over time. Using comprehensive school finance data from the Common Core of Data (CCD), we first show that receiving a sparsity aid payment increases annual spending on elementary and secondary education by approximately $225 per member. We then embed the increased spending in an instrumented different-in-differences design that instruments for a district’s total spending with their sparsity aid eligibility. Our preliminary results using district-level data from Wisconsin’s Department of Public Instruction (DPI) indicate that the increased spending induced by the program has minimal effects on districts’ average test scores. However, we find positive and statistically significant effects on college-going behavior.
