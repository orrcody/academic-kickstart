## Working Papers

### Female peers and non-cognitive outcomes in Add Health
**Abstract:** This paper studies the effect of peer gender on a variety of non-cognitive and cognitive outcomes using variation across adjacent school cohorts in the Add Health survey. Among female students, I find suggestive evidence that an increase in the share of female peers improves course grades, paying attention in class, sense of belonging, and positive beliefs about oneself. Among male students, I find an increase in the share of female peers reduces course grades and homework completion while increasing class attention and closeness to other students. Imprecision makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from these results.

### The Evolution of the Wage Elasticity of Labor Supply over Time 
*Joint with Todd Elder and Steven J. Haider*
**Abstract:** The wage elasticity of labor supply is arguably one of the most fundamental parameters in economics.  Despite the central role of this parameter, little is known about how it has changed over time.  We examine the evolution of the labor supply elasticity using cross-sectional methods.  We find robust evidence that the labor supply elasticities for married and single men and women have increased modestly over the last two decades.  For women, this finding is a substantial departure from earlier evidence.  We also contribute to the literature on the robustness of discrete choice labor supply models, focusing on assumptions that could affect our findings.  Our results suggest that the estimated trends are remarkably similar across a variety of specifications.

### Clocking into work and out of class: How college students make their enrollment and employment decisions
**Abstract:** This paper studies how college students make and finance their human capital investment decisions under financial constraints and uncertainty. I estimate a dynamic structural model where agents choose their labor supply, enrollment intensity, and borrowing to maximize lifetime utility. Data come from two sources: unique survey data of students' employment history, family financial support, and beliefs about the returns to studying and returns to earning higher grades, and merged administrative data containing students' enrollment and borrowing histories. 

### Why students do not study: Quantifying the role of expectations
**Abstract:** This paper explores the relationship between college students’ beliefs about the returns to studying and their reported study hours. Using novel survey data, I report the typical study hours of students and how study behavior differs by student observables like gender, race, college, etc. I then describe students’ beliefs about the GPA returns to studying and future labor market returns to graduating with a high GPA and quantify the heterogeneity of returns and uncertainty of returns. Next, I present correlations in the data between students’ observables and their beliefs about the returns to studying and earning a high GPA. Finally, I regress reported schoolwork hours on these beliefs to quantify the relationship between these variables.
